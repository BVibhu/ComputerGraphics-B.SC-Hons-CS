#  Computer Graphics
## Practical: 

1. Write a program to implement Bresenham's line drawing algorithm.

2. Write a program to implement mid-point circle drawing algorithm.

3. Write a program to clip a line using Cohen and Sutherland line clipping algorithm.

4. Write a program to clip a polygon using Sutherland Hodgeman algorithm.

5. Write a program to fill a polygon using Scan line fill algorithm.

6. Write a program to apply various 2D transformations on a 2D object (use homogenous coordinates).

7. Write a program to apply various 3D transformations on a 3D object and then apply parallel and perspective projection on it.

8. Write a program to draw Hermite /Bezier curve.
